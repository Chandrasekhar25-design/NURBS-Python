Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

NURBS-Python (geomdl) is a self-contained, object-oriented pure Python B-Spline and NURBS library with implementations
of curve, surface and volume generation and evaluation algorithms. It also provides convenient and easy-to-use data
structures for storing curve, surface and volume descriptions.

Some significant features of NURBS-Python are:

* Fully object-oriented API with an abstract interface
* Data structures for storing curve, surface and volume descriptions
* Helper functions, such as automatic uniform knot vector generator and many more
* Curve and surface fitting using interpolation and least squares approximation
* Integrated surface grid generator
* Visualization modules for plotting of curves, surfaces and volumes at runtime
* Shapes component for generation common surfaces and curves
* CAD exchange functionality to export and import shape data
* Support for common algorithms: tessellation, voxelization, ray intersection, etc.
* Python compatibility: 2.7.x, 3.4.x and later
* No external C/C++ or FORTRAN library dependencies
* No compilation steps are necessary, everything is implemented in pure python
* Easy to install via pip: ``pip install geomdl``
* Conda packages are also available for installation: ``conda install -c orbingol geomdl``
