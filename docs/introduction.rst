Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

NURBS-Python is an object-oriented Python library containing implementations of :doc:`NURBS <q_a>` curve and
surface generation and evaluation algorithms. It also provides a convenient and easy-to-use data structure for storing
curve and surface descriptions.

Some significant features of NURBS-Python are:

* Fully object-oriented API with an abstract interface for extensions
* Data structures for storing surface and curve descriptions (in all dimensions)
* Helper functions, such as automatic uniform knot vector generator and many more
* Control points grid generator for surfaces
* Visualization module for direct plotting of curves and surfaces
* Shapes component for generation common surfaces and curves
* CSV export functionality with customizable meshing options
* Python 2.7.x and 3.x compatibility
* No external C/C++ library dependencies
* No compilation steps are necessary, everything is implemented in pure python
* Easy to install via pip: ``pip install geomdl``
* Conda packages are also available for installation: ``conda install -c orbingol geomdl``
