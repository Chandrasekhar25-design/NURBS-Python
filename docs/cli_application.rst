Command-Line Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use geomdl with the command-line application `geomdl-cli <https://pypi.org/project/geomdl.cli/>`_. The
command-line application is designed for automation and input files are highly customizable using
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ templates. It is also extremely easy to extend the command-line application by
adding your own commands and integrating custom libraries with the configuration file.
